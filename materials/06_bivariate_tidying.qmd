## Readings 


- Reinstall the Gov 50 data package that has new data for this week:
```{r}
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github("mattblackwell/gov50data")
```

- If you cannot install the package, you can download the data locally at [`covid_votes.csv`](/files/data/covid_votes.csv)  to the same directory as your Rmd file and load it using:
```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
covid_votes <- read_csv("covid_votes.csv")
```
