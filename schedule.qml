Below is the schedule for the semester with the reading, and problem sets/exams due in each week of course. You can find the lecture slides and other materials under the "Materials" links for that week.

For the readings, we use the following codes:

- BH: Blitzstein and Hwang, [*Introduction to Probability, Second Edition*](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home).
- H1: Hansen, [*Introduction to Econometrics*](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/Probability.pdf). 
- H2: Hansen, [*Econometrics*](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf).

Here's a guide to the schedule:
