If you cannot install that package, then you can download them: [`mortality.csv`](/files/data/mortality.csv) and [`spotify.csv`](/files/data/spotify.csv). Put them in the same folder as your Rmd file and use these commands to load:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nmortality <- read_csv(\"mortality.csv\")\nspotify <- read_csv(\"spotify.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n- We will also use data from the `nycflights13` package that you can install with:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"nycflights13\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Slides\n\n- Tuesday (10/4) lecture: Summarizing relationships and writing our own functions\n  - [PDF of slides as I present them](/slides/10_bivariate.pdf)\n  - [PDF of handout version of slides](/slides/10_bivariate_handout.pdf) (no incremental slides)\n\n- Thursday (10/6) lecture: Causality review, pivoting longer, joining data.\n  - [PDF of slides as I present them](/slides/11_tidy_joins.pdf)\n  - [PDF of handout version of slides](/slides/11_tidy_joins_handout.pdf) (no incremental slides)\n \n",
