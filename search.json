    "text": "In this problem set, we’re going to get R, RStudio, and R Markdown set up on your computer. To get started, follow these steps:\n\nDownload and install the most recent version of R. There are versions available for the Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. On a Windows machine, you will want to install using the R-x.y.z-win.exe file where x.y.z is a version number. On a Mac, you will want to install using the R-x.y.z.pkg file that is notarized and signed.\nWith R installed, download and install RStudio. RStudio is a type of “integrated development environment” or IDE designed for R. It makes working with R considerably easier and is available for most platforms. It is also free.\nInstall the packages we will use throughout the semester. To do this, either type or copy and paste each of the following lines of code into the “Console” in RStudio (lower left panel by default). Make sure you do this separately for each line. If you are asked if you want to install any packages from source, type “no”. Note that the symbols next to my_package are a less than sign < followed by a minus sign - with no space between them. (Don’t be worried if you see some red text here. Those are usually just messages telling you information about the packages you are installing. Unless you see the word Error you should be fine.)\n\n\nmy_packages <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"usethis\", \"devtools\", \"learnr\",\n                 \"tinytex\", \"gitcreds\")\ninstall.packages(my_packages, repos = \"http://cran.rstudio.com\")\nremotes::install_github(\"kosukeimai/qss-package\", build_vignettes = TRUE)\n\n\nFor some things in the course, we’ll need produce PDFs from R and that requires something called LaTeX. If you’ve never heard of that, it’s completely fine and you should just run the following two lines of R code:\n\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX"

    "section": "Installing and configuring git",
    "text": "Installing and configuring git\nGit is a version control program that helps organize the process of writing and maintaining code. It allows you to maintain a history of edits to your code without having to resort to a set of files like:\nmy_code.R\nmy_code_v1.R\nmy_code_v2_FINAL.R\nThere’s a lot to git and it will be harder to use in the beginning, but in the long term there are huge benefits of it. First, when you use git, you are much less likely to encounter a devastating data failure. All of your (committed) changes to your project are preserved, even when you make new changes or you revert old changes.\nGit is also a very useful way for people to collaborate. There is a huge community built up around it. And once your projects are publicly available on Github (a website for hosting git repositories), there are a host of ways that folks can collaborate with you.\n\nInstall git\nYou might already have git installed on your computer, especially if you have a Mac. To check, in RStudio, click on the Terminal tab in the bottom-left panel (next to the Console tab). Type git --version at the command prompt. If you get a response with a version number, great you are all set. If you get any kind of error message, you learn how to install git on your machine here.\n\n\nSetup a GitHub account\nNext, you can setup a GitHub account. You can think of GitHub as similar to Dropbox or Google Drive for your git projects (“repositories”) where everything is public by default. Since you might use this account to interact with potential employers in the future, you should probably pick a professional username.\nOnce you have a GitHub account, you can configure your local git program to interact with your account gracefully. Run the following two lines of code in the Terminal replacing \"John Harvard\" with your name and \"john@harvard.edu\" with your email address used to sign up for GitHub.\ngit config --global user.name \"John Harvard\"\ngit config --global user.email \"john@harvard.edu\"\n\n\nSet up RStudio to talk to GitHub\nWe also need to set up RStudio to be able to communicate with GitHub securely. This requires a bit of fidily configuration that we luckily only have to do once. Basically, we need to get a secret code from GitHub and store it in RStudio (kind of like a app-specific password when you’re using two-factor authentication). We can start the process from by doing:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThis will open a page on GitHub asking you to create a “Personal Access Token” or PAT (this is the secret code). You’ll have to give the PAT a note that describes what it’s for and choose an expiration date. You can accept the default of 30 days but you will have to renew it a couple of times during the class. Alternatively, if you set it to a date after the semester ends, you shouldn’t have to touch this again. We recommend keeping the “scope” selections as they are and clicking the “Generate Token” button at the bottom of the page.\n\nYou will then see a new screen with a long sequence of letters. This is your token or secret code. You should treat it like a password and do not share it with anyone. If you use a password manager like 1Password or LastPass, you can put it in a secure note in those programs. Copy this by hitting the button with the two boxes.\n\nOnce you have copied the PAT, call gitcreds::gitcreds_set() from the RStudio console and paste the PAT when prompted. You should see the following:\n> gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n? Enter password or token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n-> Adding new credentials...\n-> Removing credentials from cache...\n-> Done.\nOnce this is done, you should be all set for RStudio to communicate with GitHub. If you have any problems with the PAT process or want to know more about it, the Happy Git and GitHub for the useR book has a great chapter about it.\n\n\nCreating your first repo\nOnce you are logged into Github and at its homepage, you can now create a new repo (shorthand for “repository”). These repositories are like folders in Dropbox except a bit more structured. Create one by clicking on the green “New” button in the top-left of the screen next to “Repositories.” It should look like this:\n\nNow a new screen should pop up requesting some information for the new repo. Give this new Repository the name gov50-problem-set0 and set it to be a private repository. You can give it an informative description and check the “Initialize this repository with a README” checkbox. This latter option will add a README to the repository where you can add more information that will display nicely in the repository’s homepage. Your setup should look something like this:\n\nOnce you create your repo, you are ready to connect it to RStudio on your local computer. The easiest way to do this is go to the repo homepage (you’re already there if you’ve just created it) and click on the green “Code” button toward the top right of the page. When you click that, a popup will appear and you can copy the URL (you can click the little clipboard icon to copy this automatically).\n\nNow, switch to RStudio. Go to the menu bar and hit “File > New Project”. You can then choose what type of project to start. Since we’re importing from Github, we’ll use the “Version Control” option (it’s the bottom of the list). In the next menu, choose “Git”. Now, you can paste the URL in the “Repository URL” box. Choose a set of local directories to place this project and hit “Create Project”. And now you’ll have your project ready to go in RStudio."

If you click on the “Git” tab in the top right panel, you will a list of the changes you’ve made to the repo since the last commit (you can think of a commit as a more permanent type of saving work to the git repo).\n\nOne thing you’ll notice here is that git thinks that gov50-problem-set0.Rproj is a file that maybe should go into the repo. But this file is just for our local copy of RStudio and shouldn’t really go into the repo. To prevent git from bothering us about it every time we open something, we can modify the .gitignore file to tell git to ignore certain files. Open .gitignore and add a new line with *.Rproj on it to tell git to ignore any file with the extension .Rproj. Make sure to save the file.\n\nIf you go back to the Git tab in the top right and refresh (little circular arrow in the top right corner), you see that gov50-problem-set0.Rproj is removed from our list. Now we are ready to commit our changes. Click the “Staged” box for .gitignore and README.md and hit the “Commit” button just above the file list. You’ll see a window with the changes that you are about to commit.\n\nYou can click on different files to see what exactly you are changing. Add a short but informative commit message that describes what you are committing and hit “Commit”. Once this completes, you can hit the “Push” button in the top right to push that commit back to Github.\n\nIf you go back to your repo’s homepage on Github and refresh the page, you’ll see the updates to your README file and the new .gitignore.\n\nAnd you’re done!

D. 2014. “Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111(10): 3699–3704.\n\nSubjects in the experiment were individuals riding on the commuter rail line and overwhelmingly white. Every morning, multiple trains pass through various stations in suburban communities that were used for this study. For pairs of trains leaving the same station at roughly the same time, one was randomly assigned to receive the treatment and one was designated as a control. By doing so all the benefits of randomization apply for this dataset.\nThe treatment in this experiment was the presence of two native Spanish-speaking ‘confederates’ (a term used in experiments to indicate that these individuals worked for the researcher, unbeknownst to the subjects) on the platform each morning prior to the train’s arrival. The presence of these confederates, who would appear as Hispanic foreigners to the subjects, was intended to simulate the kind of demographic change anticipated for the United States in coming years. For those individuals in the control group, no such confederates were present on the platform. The treatment was administered for 10 days. Participants were asked questions related to immigration policy both before the experiment started and after the experiment had ended.

Another way to ask the same question is this: is there evidence of a differential impact of treatment, conditional on attending college versus not attending college?\nUse group_by, summarize, pivot_wider, and mutate to create a tibble called ate_college where each row corresponds to a unique value of the college variable (so two rows total) and that has the following four columns:\n\ncollege: the unique value of the college variable for this row, labelled as either “College Grad” or “Non-College Grad”.\nTreated: the mean of the change variable for each unique value of college in the treated group.\nControl: the mean of the change variable for each unique value of college in the control group.\nATE: the difference between the treatment and control means for this value of college.\n\nIn the first step of building ate_college, you should pipe the data to a mutate() call that (a) modifies the treatment to be \"Treated\" when treatment == 1 and \"Control\" when treatment == 0 and (b) modifies the college variable to be \"College Grad\" when college == 1 and \"Non-College Grad\" when college == 0. When you do this, be sure not to overwrite the trains data with these changes, simply pipe this to the next step.\nPass the table to knitr::kable() to produce a nicely formatted table.

    "text": "Problem set workflow\nThe text of the problem sets will be posted here on the course website. We will distribute templates and data for the problem sets via Github. To get started, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the Ed Board and find the pinned thread with the GitHub Classroom links for each assignment.\nClick on the Github Classroom link for the assignment in question. You’ll be presented with a page that asks you to accept the assignment. Click “Accept this assignment”.\nGo to this new problem set repository on GitHub. Click on the green “Code” button toward the top right of the page. When you click that, a popup will appear and you can copy the URL (you can click the little clipboard icon to copy this automatically).\n\n\n\nNow, switch to RStudio. Go to the menu bar and hit “File > New Project”. You can then choose what type of project to start. Since we’re importing from Github, we’ll use the “Version Control” option (it’s the bottom of the list). In the next menu, choose “Git”. Now, you can paste the URL in the “Repository URL” box. Choose a set of local directories to place this project and hit “Create Project”. Because this is a private repository, you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. Go ahead and do this.\nAs you make changes to your file, make sure to commit those changes. Every commit is a point that you can always go back to if your code stops working for some reason. So doing this often will make sure that you have access to that great feature of git. At an absolute minimum, you should do this every time you complete a question, though you may want to do it more often than that. Committing often means you also don’t have to constantly create new versions of the same file because you’re afraid of making some change. Also, make sure to use informative commit messages so you know what’s changing. Important: be sure to answer the questions in the Rmd file provided by the template. This is what the autograder will look for when you submit.\nAt some point, you’ll want to push your changes back to GitHub so the teaching staff can see your work (if you need help) or so that you can submit to Gradescope."

    "text": "Submitting your assignments\n\nStep 1: Download your GitHub repo as a zip file\n\nOnce you are think you have completed the assignment, make sure to push your commits to GitHub and then go to the repository website and download the repo as a .zip file under the green “Code” button. It’s important to use the default name for the zip file, so you may have to delete an older zip file if you have already downloaded it to the same location. In general, it will have the structure problem-set-X-username-main.zip where X is the problem set number and username is your GitHub username. Note: do not add this zip file to your repository.\n\n\nStep 2: Submit the zip file to Gradescope\nOn Gradescope, you’ll find two entries for each assignment. One will be labelled “Zip File” and the other “PDF”. Click on the Zip File entry and drag/select your zip into the box. Click “Upload.”\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check autograder output\nWhen you submit the zip file, Gradescope will run a series of tests on your code to see if it runs and to check that you have completed the coding tasks asked of you in the assignment. You’ll see a list of test results and an overall score.\n\nCheck the messages on any questions you got wrong for hints about how to fix them. You may then re-upload the zip file again once you have fixed the code. You should repeat this process as many times as needed before you get a perfect score.\nIf you get an autograder error saying “The autograder failed to execute correctly” and you are using the Safari browser on macOS, check to see if Safari is unzipping the zip file automatically upon download. If it is, you can turn off this setting by following these instructions.\n\n\nStep 4: Upload PDF\nOnce you are satisfied with your autograding, then you should produce your final PDF report by hitting the “Knit” button at the top of the RStudio editor. This should produce a PDF output that you can then upload to Gradescope. In Gradescope, there will be an assignment labelled “Problem Set X: PDF”. There, you will be prompted to upload your final PDF report. You’ll be asked to indicate on which page each answer is. Label the PDF with where those answers are (being sure to mark two different pages if an answer continues on two pages)."

    "text": "Writing good code\nYou’ll be writing code to do the analyses in this class. Code, like any language, provides many different ways of saying the same thing. One good practice of coding is to have what’s called good coding style. This refers to how you format the code that you so that it is (a) easy for you and others to read, and (b) less prone to making mistakes. Here are some general guidelines for writing R code and Rmd file.\n\nWhen writing R code and unless we tell you otherwise, follow the tidyverse style guide. For this class, the relevant parts of this document are the first couple of chapters. If you are ever uncertain about how to name something or how to write some code, see this document and it will likely help you quite a bit.\nMake sure the code chunks in the Rmd file have blank lines above and below them. If you don’t have this, it can sometimes cause problems with compilation.\nTry to keep your lines of code shorter than 80 characters since this makes reading code much easier. Usually this means writing some function arguments on a different line. See the style guide (section 2.5) for more on this.\nInclude comments in your code and format them nicely as in section 3.4 of the style guide. These comments should explain why you wrote the code you wrote and any notes you had about how you came to this solution. This might include, say, other approaches you tried but didn’t work or approaches you might want to try if you ever revisit this. Look at our code and examples to get a sense of how to use comments. In RStudio, you can nicely format a comment by hitting Control-Shift-\\."

    "text": "Course objectives\nIn this course, you will learn the basics of data science as applied to the social sciences. This involves two broad skill sets: (1) learning the computing and programming tools to both manage and analyze data; and (2) understanding the conceptual foundations of why we might manage or analyze data in one way versus another. This course will address both of these topics.\nSpecifically, at the end of the course you should be able to:\n\nSummarize and visualize data\nWrangle messy data into tidy forms\nEvaluate claims about causality\nBe able to use linear regression to analyze data\nUnderstand uncertainty in data analysis and how to quantify it\nUse professional tools for data analysis such as R, RStudio, git, and GitHub\n\nWe will also attempt to inspire a passion for data analysis and create a community among the students to deepen their learning.\n\nExpectations\nIn this course, you will be expected to\n\ncomplete eight problem sets,\ncomplete ten weekly tutorials,\ntake two take-home, open-book exams, and\nwrite one final data analysis project.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNo prerequisites will be assumed. If you are unfamiliar with downloading and installing software programs on your Mac or PC, you may want to allocate additional time to make sure those aspects of the course go smoothly. In particular, we have developed a Problem Set 0 to guide you through installing R, RStudio, and git to give you a sense of the tools we will be using.\n\n\nCredit\nThis course satisfies the Methods requirement for the Government department and the “Quantitative Reasoning with Data” requirement in the Harvard College Curriculum. It also counts toward completion of the Government department data science track.\n\n\nSpeaker Series\nWe are planning a Gov 50 Speaker Series that will host optional events with guests from the world of data science. More information coming soon…"

    "text": "Course structure\n\nFlow of the Course\nThe course will follow a basic flow each week, with small differences if a tutorial or problem set is due or not.\n\nMonday: Complete reading/watching course material, complete tutorial (if due).\nTuesday: Lecture meets.\nWednesday: Submit problem set by 11:55 PM (if due).\nThursday: Lecture meets; problem sets and exams posted; sections meet.\nFriday: Sections meet.\nSunday: Submit exams by 11:55 PM (if due)\n\n\n\nTutorials\nWe will assign short weekly tutorials to assess your knowledge of the material covered in the reading/video materials that week. While you are expected to complete them on time, they will be graded based on completion not on how correct the answers are. They will be due Mondays at 11:59pm ET.\n\n\nLectures\nWe will meet twice a week for lectures where I will combine presenting material and doing live coding demonstrations. Ideally, you should bring your laptop to class and be ready to code along with me!\n\n\nSections\nSections will be small-group settings to practice the tools and techniques that we cover in class. These meetings are essential to gaining the skills you need for the problem sets, exams, and final project.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nOnly reading about data science is about as instructive as reading a lot about hammers or watching someone else wield a hammer. You need to get your hands on a hammer or two. Thus, in this course, you will have mostly-weekly problem sets that will give you an opportunity to apply the statistical techniques you are learning. They will usually be focused on data analysis in general and will often involve a real dataset.\nWe encourage students to rely on peer working groups as they work on these homeworks, but each student will submit their own work individually. We will facilitate the formation of homework peer groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace policy\n\n\n\nWhen calculating the final homework portion of the overall grade, we will drop the lowest score and use the remaining scores. Thus, if you have an emergency that forces you to miss one homework, your grade will not be severely affected.\n\n\n\n\nExams\nThere will be two take-home exams during the course. This exam will be similar to a homework in format and in the sense that it will be open book and open internet, but you will not be allowed to collaborate with other students or be able to communicate with any humans about the exam. You will be given several days to complete the exam. We will provide more information about the exam as it approaches.\n\n\n\nExam\nRelease Date\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nExam 1\nThu, Oct 13th 5:00pm ET\nSun, Oct 16th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nExam 2\nThu, Dec 1st 5:00pm ET\nSun, Dec 4th 11:59pm ET\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe will be using the Ed platform for discussions on course material. There is a users guide to help orient yourself to the platform. We will enroll you into the platform toward the start of the semester.\n\n\nGrading\nYou (the student) and I (the instructor) should care the most about what you learn, not what numerical/letter summary of that learning you get at the end of the semester. So I would love to not have grades at all, but unfortunately we humans are very good at procrastinating on our good intentions when there is no incentive not to. Thus, we have grades to help solve this commitment problem and to encourage you to put effort into learning the course material.\nHere are how each portion of course contributes to the overall grade:\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nR Tutorials\n10%\n\n\nProblem Sets\n40%\n\n\nExams\n30%\n\n\nFinal Project\n20%\n\n\n\nWe will use Gradescope for submission of the various assignments throughout the semester. Once enrollment is finished, Gradescope will automatically connect through Canvas.\nBump-up policy: We reserve the right to “bump up” the grades of students who have made valuable contributions to the course in the lecture, sections, study halls, or discussion/Slack. This also applies to students who show tremendous progress and growth over the semester."

    "title": "Syllabus",
    "section": "Final Project",
    "text": "Final Project\nThe final project is a data analysis project about whatever data excites you. That could be public opinion in U.S. elections, United Nations voting patterns, patterns of racial discrimination in police behavior, the distribution of salaries in basketball, or the economics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. No matter the topic, you will formula a key research question, find data on that question, answer the question using the tools of the course, and present those results for public consumption.\nThe goal is for this to be a professional project that you can use to showcase the skills that you have gained to potential employers. Your final submission will be a publicly available article/website that contains: (1) a brief introduction to the research question and data collected; (2) a visualization of the data in question that speaks to your research question; (3) a presentation (as a table or graph) of a regression model assessing your question along with a plain-English interpretation; (4) a brief (one-paragraph) section that describes limitations of your analysis and threats to inference, and states how your analysis could be improved (e.g., improved data that would be useful to collect). Finally, there must be a link to the GitHub repo that contains the source code to load, clean, and analyze the data and produce the article.\nThe data collection and cleaning must be meaningful—it’s not sufficient to simply use a pre-cleaned data from an R package. Self-collected data is allowed and even encouraged, though beware that it can only be used for the final project itself only unless you go through human subjects approval from the University.\n\n\n\nMilestone\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nProposal\nWed, Oct 28th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nDraft Analyses\nWed, Nov 18th 11:59pm ET\n\n\nFinal Report\nMon, Dec 14th 11:59pm ET"

    "text": "Course Policies\n\nRegrading Policy\nIf you feel there has been an error in the grading of one your assignment, you may request (in writing) a regrade of the assignment. Please send your request in an email to Professor Blackwell and the Head TF. A member of the teaching staff will regrade the entire assignment, not just the part you are disputing. Therefore, your regrade might increase or decrease the overall grade on the assignment.\n\n\nOffice Hours and Availability\nMy office hours are Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:30pm-3:00pm ET. If you have questions about the course material, computational issues, or other course-related issues please do not hesitate to set up an appointment with either any of us.\nIf you have a general question, you should post it to the Ed discussion board (where you can make your question anonymous if you would like). This is almost always the fastest way to get an answer. However, you can also email me directly at mblackwell@gov.harvard.edu if you have a question that is about a personal situation.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nThe work that you do in both the problem sets should be your own work. You may seek help from others so long as this does not result in someone else completing your work for you. When asking for help, you may show others your code to help diagnose a bug or highlight a potential issue, but you should not view their (working) code. You should cite any discussions you have with other students in your problem set and note if they helped you with your code. You should never copy and paste code from another student or elsewhere (e.g., websites, former students).\nI also strongly suggest that you make a solo effort at all the problems before consulting others. The exams will be very difficult if you have no experience working on your own. There is no collaboration allowed on the exams."

R is free, open source, and available on all major platforms (including Solaris, so no excuses). RStudio (also free) is a graphical interface to R that is widely used to work with the R language. You can find a virtually endless set of resources for R and RStudio on the internet. For beginners, there are several web-based tutorials. In these, you will be able to learn the basic syntax of R. We’ll post more R resources on the course website. We will also use git and Github to manage our projects.\nYou can get setup with all of these tools by completing Problem Set 0."
