## Week 1: R Basics and Data Visualization

### Creating a vector 



```{r}
## Any R code that begins with the # character is a comment
## Comments are ignored by R

my_numbers <- c(4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42) # Anything after # is also a
# comment
my_numbers
```


### Installing and loading a package

You can install a package with the `install.packages` function, passing the name of the package to be installed as a string (that is, in quotes):

```{r}
#| eval = FALSE
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

You can load a package into the R environment by calling `library()` with the name of package without quotes. You should only have one package per library call. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
