# Gov50: Data Science for the Social Sciences <a href='https://gov50.mattblackwell.org/'><img src='files/img/gov50-icon-512.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

This repo houses the [Quarto][] sources for the Gov 50 website. It is largely inspired by [Andrew Heiss's](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) site for his class [Program Evaluation for Public Service](https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com). 

## How to build this site

1. Install [RStudio][] version 2022.07.1 of later since it installs [Quarto][] with it or just download and install [Quarto][] separately. 
2. Open `gov50-f22-site.Rproj` in as an RStudio Project.
3. Edit files as needed and hit the "Render" button to preview the changes locally. 
4. Commit changes and push them to GitHub. GitHub Actions will build the site and deploy it to [https://gov50.mattblackwell.org](https://gov50.mattblackwell.org).
