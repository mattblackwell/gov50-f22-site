# Gov50: Data Science for the Social Sciences

This repo houses the [Quarto][] sources for the Gov 50 website. It is largely inspired by [Andrew Heiss's](https://www.andrewheiss.com/) site for his class [Program Evaluation for Public Service](https://github.com/andrewheiss/evalf22.classes.andrewheiss.com). 

## How to build this site

1. Install [RStudio][] version 2022.07.1 of later since it installs [Quarto][] with it or just download and install [Quarto][] separately. 
2. Open `gov50-f22.Rproj` in as an RStudio Project.
